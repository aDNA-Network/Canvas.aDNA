# Session — Operation Salon P3: leg-3 interface-surface spec

## Intent

Open Phase P3 of Operation Salon and author the greenfield **leg-3 interface-surface spec**
(`what/specs/spec_interface_surface.md`) — defining a canvas as a human↔AI / human↔human interaction surface, *as a
contract bounded by ADR-006* (no routing, no engine, no transport; rides `_reserved.interaction` additively). Then file
the D8 coordination heads-up memos to aDNA.aDNA (OIP) + ISS. **HOLD at the P3 ratification gate** — present the draft;
never self-ratify or open P4.

## Operator decisions (this session, plan-mode)

1. **Proceed first-principles** (not defer) — the external "OIP/interface thesis doc" the campaign nominally gated on
   does **not** exist (it is a future deliverable of the unopened `aDNA.aDNA` "Operation Concord" / OIP-unification
   campaign). The P3 gate explicitly allows "ratified **or** explicitly deferred"; ratified **D4** scoped leg-3 as
   **spec-only**; the risk-register mitigation is "spec-only default + coordinate early." So author the spec now,
   Canvas-scoped v1, grounded on what exists (ADR-006 + the proven leg-2 model + ISS exemplar).
2. **Concrete shape + I-\* checks** — fix the additive `_reserved.interaction` JSON shape and propose an `I-*`
   conformance family (mirroring how leg-2 fixed `context_object`'s shape).

## Scope declaration

- **Create:** `what/specs/spec_interface_surface.md`; `…/missions/mission_p3_interface_surface_spec.md`; this session;
  two `who/coordination/` D8 memos (Canvas↔OIP, Canvas↔ISS).
- **Modify (shared governance):** `STATE.md` (resume block); `…/campaign_canvas_salon.md` (P3 row + risk note);
  `…/campaign_canvas_salon/CLAUDE.md` (current-phase line); `what/specs/AGENTS.md` (index the new spec).
- **Firewall (DO NOT TOUCH):** `what/code/canvas_std/` — verify `git status -s -- what/code/canvas_std/` clean at close.

## Conflict scan

- `how/sessions/active/` — only this session (checked at open).
- Repo `ahead 1` of origin/master (Hestia pt09-P5 relocation note `4c55663`, unpushed). Pushes operator-gated; this
  session stacks a local commit, does not push.

## Work log

- Opened P3; created session file.
- Authored `what/specs/spec_interface_surface.md` (leg-3 contract; mirrors leg-2 spec structure 1:1).
- Authored `mission_p3_interface_surface_spec.md` (P3 mission, `in_progress`).
- Filed D8 coord memos (Canvas↔OIP, Canvas↔ISS) — canonical in Canvas `who/coordination/`; delivery copies staged
  uncommitted in `aDNA.aDNA/who/coordination/` (commit operator-gated).
- Governance currency: STATE.md resume block; campaign master (P3 row → in_progress + risk-register resolution note);
  campaign CLAUDE.md; `what/specs/AGENTS.md` index.
- Verified firewall `git status -s -- what/code/canvas_std/` clean (spec-only; no code). Re-checked HEAD: Hestia
  committed `e33a871` (single test file) mid-session — **no overlap** with my changeset; committing separately.

## SITREP

**Completed**
- Leg-3 interface-surface spec **drafted** (`spec_interface_surface.md`, `status: draft`) — the `read → act → re-read`
  loop over the leg-2 `ContextGraph`; 5 primitives (`anchor`/`affordance`/`response`/`surface state`/`turn`); concrete
  `_reserved.interaction` shape; IX1–IX6; round-trip-to-baseline; proposed `I-*` conformance family; ADR-006 boundary
  table; 9 open questions flagged for ratification.
- D8 coordination memos filed (canonical in Canvas; delivery copies staged in aDNA.aDNA, uncommitted).
- P3 mission opened; campaign + STATE + specs index current.

**In progress**
- Mission `mission_p3_interface_surface_spec` — completes (with AAR) **at operator ratification**, not at draft.

**Next up (operator)**
- Ratify the leg-3 draft (resolving the 9 open questions). On ratification: flip spec `status → ratified`, fold the
  `I-*` family into `spec_conformance_suite.md` (separate ratified edit), complete the mission (+AAR), campaign P3 →
  completed. **Then HOLD** at the P3→P4 gate (P4 is a stretch — do not open without the operator).
- Operator-gated: commit/cross-post the aDNA.aDNA delivery copies into aDNA.aDNA's git; push the Canvas batch.

**Blockers**
- None. The former High-risk OIP-thesis dependency is resolved (proceed-first-principles).

**Files touched**
- Created: `what/specs/spec_interface_surface.md`; `…/missions/mission_p3_interface_surface_spec.md`; this session; 2
  Canvas `who/coordination/` memos; 2 staged aDNA.aDNA delivery copies (untracked there).
- Modified: `STATE.md`; `…/campaign_canvas_salon.md`; `…/campaign_canvas_salon/CLAUDE.md`; `what/specs/AGENTS.md`.
- Firewall: `what/code/canvas_std/` untouched (git-diff 0).

## Next Session Prompt

Operation Salon is at **P3, HELD at the ratification gate**. The leg-3 interface-surface spec
(`what/specs/spec_interface_surface.md`, `status: draft`) is authored — a canvas as a human↔AI/human↔human interaction
surface, as a contract bounded by `adr_006` (no routing/engine/transport; rides `_reserved.interaction`). It defines the
`read → act → re-read` loop over the leg-2 `ContextGraph`, five primitives (anchor/affordance/response/surface
state/turn), a concrete `_reserved.interaction` shape, IX1–IX6, the round-trip-to-baseline property, and a proposed
`I-*` conformance family; 9 open questions are flagged in its closing note. **To continue: review the draft + the 9 open
questions and either ratify or send back.** On ratification — flip `status → ratified`, fold `I-*` into
`spec_conformance_suite.md` (A-5/A-7 precedent), complete `mission_p3_interface_surface_spec` (+AAR), set campaign P3 →
completed, and HOLD at the P3→P4 gate (P4 = stretch POC, operator-gated). D8 memos are filed (canonical in Canvas;
delivery copies staged uncommitted in `aDNA.aDNA/who/coordination/` — committing them into aDNA.aDNA + pushing the
Canvas batch are operator-gated). Firewall clean; `canvas_std` untouched.
