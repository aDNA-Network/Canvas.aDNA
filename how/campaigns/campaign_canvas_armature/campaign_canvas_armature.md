# Campaign: Operation Armature — leg-3 interface runtime

## Goal

Turn Operation Salon's **ratified** leg-3 interface-surface spec + its **demonstrated** `read → act → re-read` loop into
a **real, governed leg-3 interaction runtime** — completing the interface leg of the three-leg Canvas thesis. When this
campaign completes: (1) a response advances the surface and is **reconciled back to the authoritative `.lattice.yaml`**
through the *advisory* round-trip path (a reviewed draft, never a silent write); and (2) the `I-1/I-2/I-3` interaction
conformance family — today realized only in the `canvas_context` consumer — is **wired into the `canvas_std` harness +
CLI** and `interaction_version 1.0` is **cut into a Standard version**, the first deliberate touch of the
frozen-since-Keystone `canvas_std` firewall.

This is a **build campaign** (the Keystone model), not a planning arc: Salon already chartered, specified, and bounded
leg 3 (spec-only, charter D4). Operation Armature builds the runtime the Salon Completion Summary §Descoped explicitly
deferred. It HOLDs at every phase gate (SO-1); the firewall touch is isolated to a single, separately-gated phase.

## Context

Operation Salon closed 2026-06-22 with the three-leg thesis complete *on paper* — leg 1 (output, ×7 producers) and
leg 2 (context object, the `canvas_context` loader) **proven**, leg 3 (interface surface) **ratified + POC-demonstrated**
([[../campaign_canvas_salon/campaign_canvas_salon|Operation Salon]] §Completion Summary). But Salon deliberately stopped
leg 3 at **spec-only** (charter D4). Three gaps remain, named in the follow-on stub
([[../../backlog/idea_campaign_leg3_interface_runtime|idea_campaign_leg3_interface_runtime]], `proposed`) and the Salon
§Descoped:

- **The governed round-trip write is out of scope.** The POC's `apply_response`
  ([[../../../what/code/canvas_context/src/canvas_context/interaction|interaction.py]] v0.2.0) is a pure **view-only
  append-fold** — it advances the *view* and never writes the authoritative `.lattice.yaml`
  ([[../../../what/specs/spec_interface_surface|spec_interface_surface]] §7.2). An honest runtime closes that loop to
  source — via the **advisory** reverse path ([[../../../what/specs/spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2|spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2]]
  §1.2/§5), a reviewed draft, never a silent authoritative mutation.
- **`I-*` lives in the consumer, not the harness.** The `I-1/I-2/I-3/I-D` family is realized in `canvas_context`
  (`validate_interaction_block`), forward-pointed into the `canvas_std` harness "with a leg-3 reference reader" at Salon
  P3 ([[../../../what/specs/spec_conformance_suite|spec_conformance_suite]] §4.1; spec_interface_surface §9.1/§10). Wiring
  it into `canvas_std/validate.py` is the **first leg-3 touch of the firewall** — a ratifiable decision (ADR-007), the
  leg-3 analogue of Salon's D6 (which chose to *preserve* the firewall for leg 2).
- **`interaction_version 1.0` was never cut as a Standard version.** The spec rides `_reserved.interaction` additively at
  `standard_version 2.0.2` + `interaction_version 1.0`; the spec's ratification Q7 deferred the Standard-version cut to
  "a deliberate release." This campaign is that release.

**Operator decisions at this campaign's open** (AskUserQuestion, planning session
`session_stanley_20260622_193153_armature_scaffold_p0`): **codename = Operation Armature**; **firewall posture = include
the `canvas_std` touch as a gated P2** (governed by ADR-007 — the operator chose to *lift* the firewall for this bounded
purpose, reversing the standing preserve default precisely because the leg-3 thesis needs `I-*` to be a real Standard
check, not just consumer code). Approved plan: `~/.claude/plans/please-read-the-claude-md-glimmering-teapot.md`.

## Scope

### In Scope

- **The governed round-trip write runtime** — promote `apply_response` from a view-only fold to a runtime that
  reconciles a response back to the authoritative `.lattice.yaml` **via the advisory reverse path** (staleness check →
  draft → diff → three-way merge → human-review gate → regenerate), built on the existing
  `canvas_std.roundtrip` (`diff`/`merge`/`preserve_positions`/`compute_sync_hash`/`from_canvas`/`to_canvas`), imported
  read-only. Firewall-clean (P1).
- **The `canvas_std` firewall touch (gated, P2 only, per ratified ADR-007)** — wire `validate_interaction` (I-1/I-2/I-3)
  into `canvas_std/validate.py`'s aDNA-Native path (reusing `reserved.validate_anchors`); surface it through
  `conformance.validate_suite` + the `canvas-std` CLI; add an interaction-bearing golden to `canvas_std/tests`. The
  consumer's `validate_interaction_block` becomes a thin delegate/re-export.
- **The `interaction_version 1.0` Standard-version cut (P2, per ADR-007 + decision-record D6)** — bump
  `STANDARD_VERSION` + schema + CLI + spec frontmatters; flip the `spec_conformance_suite §4.1` + `spec_interface_surface
  §10` forward-pointers from "forward-pointed" → "implemented." Coordinated with the in-review **LIP-0008** v2.1.0 line.
- **A runnable pilot** — operator annotates a canvas → an agent re-reads it as context → responds → a **reviewed**
  `.lattice.yaml` draft is emitted (the on-disk source unchanged).
- **The OIP `v1.x` re-anchor — as a deferred stub** (filed, not built; cross-vault dep).

### Out of Scope

- **Cross-surface routing** (when to use Canvas vs ISS vs Terminal vs web) — the future `aDNA.aDNA` OIP-unification
  campaign owns it ([[../../../what/decisions/adr_006_canvas_surface_boundary|adr_006]] §3, the load-bearing line).
- **The ISS gate engine** — HTML rendering, capture runtime, RLHF schema, the 4-tier round-trip (ADR-006 §2). Canvas
  owns the affordance/anchor/response/turn *grammar*; ISS owns the gate *engine*.
- **A silent authoritative write to source** — the governed write is **advisory** (a reviewed draft); a tool MUST NOT
  silently propagate canvas/response edits to the `.lattice.yaml` (spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2 §1.2).
- **Rendering / capture / transport / web publication / image rendering** — fenced by ADR-006.
- **Canvas-as-primitive** (Δ2 / LIP-0009) — stays on its own LIP track; the interaction layer rides `_reserved`, no
  core-primitive change.
- **The OIP `v1.x` re-anchor build** — deferred (cross-vault dep on the unopened `aDNA.aDNA` OIP campaign).

### Subsumes

| Plan/Mission | Status at Subsumption | Tasks Absorbed By |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `how/backlog/idea_campaign_leg3_interface_runtime.md` | `proposed` → graduates to this campaign on P0 ratification | the campaign as a whole (mark `implemented` at P3 close) |

## Phases & Missions

> Missions are authored thin and only at phase entry (SO-3 context budget). Only P0 is authored at open.

### Phase P0: Charter + decision record + ADR-007 draft  *(this session)*

| Mission | Title | Sessions | Dependencies | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | P0 — Charter + 8-decision record + ADR-007 draft | 1 | — | completed |

**Phase exit gate (P0→P1, HUMAN)**: the operator ratifies the **P0 decision record** (8 decisions — codename · campaign
type/arc · firewall posture · governed-write semantics · runtime home · Standard-version coordination · capture/turn
scope · OIP re-anchor posture) **and** `adr_007`. Ratification **activates** the campaign (`status: active`) and opens
P1. **✅ MET 2026-06-22** — all 8 ratified at the agent's recommended values; `adr_007` accepted; campaign `active`.

### Phase P1: Governed round-trip write runtime (firewall-clean)

| Mission | Title | Sessions | Dependencies | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 2 | P1 — Governed write runtime + pilot | 2-3 | P0 | completed |

**Phase exit gate**: a response reconciles to a **reviewed** `.lattice.yaml` source draft via the advisory reverse path
(no silent write); the pilot runs end-to-end; `canvas_context` tests green; **`canvas_std` firewall git-diff 0**
(runtime is a read-only consumer of `canvas_std`). **✅ MET 2026-06-22** — `reconcile.py` (canvas_context 0.3.0) +
source fixture + 8 tests + pilot; `canvas_context` **58 passed**, `ruff` clean, `canvas_std` **82/10** unchanged,
**firewall git-diff 0**; the on-disk authoritative source is byte-unchanged after the loop. **⛔ HELD at the P1→P2 gate.**

### Phase P2: Firewall touch — wire I-* into canvas_std + cut the Standard version  *(per ratified ADR-007)*

| Mission | Title | Sessions | Dependencies | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | P2 — I-* into the harness + interaction_version Standard-version cut | 1-2 | P1, ADR-007 ratified | completed |

**Phase exit gate**: `I-1/I-2/I-3` validate natively through the `canvas-std` CLI on an interaction-bearing golden;
`interaction_version 1.0` is cut into the Standard version; **D-1..D-3 still prove round-trip-to-baseline** on that
golden; **full regression green** (`canvas_std` + `canvas_context` + 7 producers). This is the *only* phase that edits
`canvas_std` — entered only on the operator's explicit approval at the P1→P2 gate, behind ADR-007. **✅ MET 2026-06-23**
— `I-*` validate via the `canvas-std 2.2.0` CLI on `adna_interaction.canvas`; `interaction_version 1.0` cut → **v2.2.0**;
D-1..D-3 green on the golden; **full regression GREEN** (`canvas_std` **105/10** · `canvas_context` **58** · 7 producers
**223**; `ruff` clean); the firewall touch is **+159/−9 across 9 files** (logic = `validate_interaction` + a 1-line
dispatch). **⛔ HELD at the P2→P3 gate.**

### Phase P3: Close

| Mission | Title | Sessions | Dependencies | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 4 | P3 — Validation, iii/ review, AAR, doc currency, OIP stub | 1 | P1, P2 | completed |

**Phase exit gate**: cross-suite sweep green (no regression); structural `iii/` review of the runtime + pilot;
Completion Summary + Campaign AAR filed; doc currency done; the leg-3 runtime backlog idea marked `implemented`; the OIP
`v1.x` re-anchor filed as a deferred stub; `status: completed`. **✅ MET 2026-06-23** — sweep green (`canvas_std` 105/10
· `canvas_context` 58 · 7 producers 223); `iii/feedback_2026_06_23_leg3_interaction_runtime.md` (0 High / 0 Med → SHIP);
Completion Summary + Campaign AAR (above); patterns graduated → `context_canvas_surface_legs.md`; `idea_campaign_leg3_interface_runtime`
`implemented`; `idea_oip_v1x_interface_reanchor` filed; `canvas_std` git-diff 0 restored; **campaign `completed`; P0–P3 pushed.**

## Decision Points

| # | When | Decision | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| D1 | P0→P1 gate | Codename / slug (Operation Armature / `campaign_canvas_armature`) | ratified 2026-06-22 |
| D2 | P0→P1 gate | Campaign type & phase arc (4-phase build campaign P0–P3, Keystone model, each human-gated) | ratified 2026-06-22 |
| D3 | P0→P1 gate | Firewall posture — **lift** `canvas_std` in a gated P2 (wire I-* + cut version) via `adr_007` | ratified 2026-06-22 (w/ `adr_007`) |
| D4 | P0→P1 gate | Governed-write semantics (advisory-reverse / reviewed draft; no silent source write) | ratified 2026-06-22 |
| D5 | P0→P1 gate | Runtime home (extend `canvas_context` vs new `canvas_runtime` sibling) | ratified 2026-06-22 — extend `canvas_context` |
| D6 | P0→P1 gate | Standard-version coordination (cut `interaction_version 1.0` into v2.2.0; LIP-or-discretion; vs v2.1.0) | ratified 2026-06-22 — v2.2.0, maintainer discretion |
| D7 | P0→P1 gate | Capture / turn-lifecycle / operator-annotation scope (thin pilot path only; gate engine stays ISS's) | ratified 2026-06-22 |
| D8 | P0→P1 gate | OIP `v1.x` re-anchor posture (deferred stub; cross-vault dep) | ratified 2026-06-22 |

All eight are recorded with defaults + rationale + alternatives in `missions/artifacts/p0_decision_record.md`. **All
ratified 2026-06-22 at the agent's recommended values** (P0→P1 gate); the campaign is `active` at P1.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **First-ever `canvas_std` edit** — regression across 82 `canvas_std` tests + 7 producers + `canvas_context` | High | The touch is isolated to a single, separately-gated phase (P2) governed by `adr_007`; the P2 exit gate is **full regression green** + D-1..D-3 on an interaction golden, not git-diff 0; P0/P1/P3 stay git-diff 0 |
| Governed write drifts into a **silent authoritative write** to source (violates spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2 §1.2) | High | The runtime emits a `_draft`/`_merged`-marked reviewed draft + a human-review gate; a test asserts the on-disk `.lattice.yaml` is byte-unchanged after `reconcile` |
| Boundary creep into **ISS** (capture/gate engine) or **OIP** (routing) | Medium | `adr_006` is the binding fence; the runtime builds the *grammar's* reconcile path, not a gate engine or a router; no routing logic |
| **Standard-version collision** with the in-review LIP-0008 (→ v2.1.0, FA review closes 2026-06-27) | Medium | D6 default reserves v2.1.0 for LIP-0008 and cuts `interaction_version` into **v2.2.0** (or folds into v2.1.0 only if LIP-0008 lands first); coordinate at the P2 gate |
| **OIP cross-vault dependency** (the `v1.x` re-anchor) blocks the build | Low | The runtime builds on the ratified Canvas-scoped v1 spec; the re-anchor is additive (`interaction_version` semver) and deferred to a stub — not a blocker (idea stub §Discussion) |
| Scope too large to gate cleanly | Medium | Keystone-model build; thin missions at phase entry; HOLD at every gate (SO-1); the firewall touch is its own phase |

## Verification Strategy

### Per-Mission

| Check | Method | Gate? |
|-------|--------|-------|
| SITREP filed | Session closure protocol | Yes |
| AAR produced | 5-step AAR (in-doc) | Yes |
| Deliverables validated | AAR scorecard | Yes |
| Files committed | Git status clean (operator-gated push) | Yes |

### Per-Phase

| Check | Method | Gate? |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase exit criteria met | Campaign doc phase exit gate | Yes — user approval |
| **`canvas_std` firewall** | `git status -s -- what/code/canvas_std/` clean for **P0/P1/P3** | Yes — at those gates |
| **P2 regression** (firewall lifted) | Full suites green: `canvas_std` (82/10 + I-* rows) + `canvas_context` (50+) + 7 producers (305) + D-1..D-3 on an interaction golden | Yes — the P2 gate replaces git-diff 0 with full regression |
| Round-trip-to-baseline | `strip(interaction_golden)` validates at Core (D-1) | Yes — P2 |
| Risk register updated | Campaign doc risk register | No — recommended |

### Campaign Validation

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| New ADR indexed | `what/decisions/AGENTS.md` + ADR sequence coherent (`adr_007`) |
| Runtime patterns graduated | `skill_context_graduation` → a `what/context/` guide (P3) |
| Backlog idea closed | `idea_campaign_leg3_interface_runtime` → `implemented` (P3) |
| STATE.md updated | Campaign status reflected in operational state |
| OIP re-anchor filed | Deferred stub created (P3) |

## Timeline

| Phase | Missions | Sessions |
|-------|----------|----------|
| P0 Charter + decisions + ADR-007 | 1 | 1 |
| P1 Governed write runtime + pilot | 1 | 2-3 |
| P2 Firewall touch + version cut | 1 | 1-2 |
| P3 Close | 1 | 1 |
| **Total** | **4 missions** | **5-9 sessions** |

## Notes

- **Firewall posture is the inverse of Salon's.** Salon D6 *preserved* the `canvas_std` firewall (leg-2 loader = a new
  read-only sibling). Armature D3/`adr_007` *lifts* it — deliberately, for one bounded purpose (wire the already-ratified
  `I-*` family into the harness + cut the version), isolated to P2. Every other phase holds git-diff 0. This is the
  single biggest governance call of the campaign and is an explicit operator decision (taken this planning session),
  recorded as `adr_007`.
- **Advisory, not silent.** The "governed round-trip write" is governed *because* it is advisory — `spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2`
  §1.2 forbids silent source propagation. The runtime closes the loop by emitting a reviewed draft through the §5
  diff→merge→human-review→regenerate path, reusing the existing `roundtrip.py` machinery. The honesty the POC bought with
  a view-only fold, the runtime keeps with a review gate.
- **Reuse over rebuild.** P1 builds on `canvas_std.roundtrip` (already has `diff`/`merge`/`preserve_positions`/
  `compute_sync_hash`/`from_canvas`/`to_canvas`) + the POC's `apply_response`; P2 reuses `reserved.validate_anchors` for
  I-2. The campaign writes glue + the reconcile path + the harness wiring, not new core algorithms.
- **Version coordination.** LIP-0008 (A-5 relaxation) is in FA review → v2.1.0 on Final (closes 2026-06-27). D6 default
  reserves v2.1.0 for it and cuts `interaction_version 1.0` into **v2.2.0**, to avoid a two-change collision in one
  version; revisit at the P2 gate if LIP-0008 has already landed.

## Completion Summary

**Operation Armature COMPLETE — 2026-06-23.** The leg-3 interface *runtime* is built, the first deliberate `canvas_std`
edit since Operation Keystone is landed under a ratified bounded-touch ADR, and the three-leg Canvas thesis is now
fully runtime-enabled. A 4-phase build (Keystone model), HELD at every gate; the firewall touch was isolated to one
separately-gated phase. Full regression green at close: **`canvas_std` 105/10 · `canvas_context` 58 · 7 producers 223**;
`ruff` clean; `canvas-std 2.2.0` CLI validates the interaction golden `[OK]` (D-1/D-2/D-3).

### Deliverables
- **P0 — charter + decision record + ADR-007.** The 8-decision record (codename · arc · firewall posture ·
  governed-write semantics · runtime home · version coordination · capture scope · OIP posture) + `adr_007` (the
  leg-3 firewall-touch ADR, the inverse of Salon's firewall-preserving D6), **ratified at the agent's recs**.
- **P1 — governed advisory-reverse write runtime (firewall-clean).** `canvas_context/reconcile.py` (0.2.0 → **0.3.0**):
  `reconcile` (staleness gate · topology `diff` · three-way `merge` draft · §6 lossy-field restore · response payload) ·
  `governed_apply` · `write_source_draft`, all over `canvas_std.roundtrip` read-only. A response advances the view →
  reconciles to a **reviewed source draft**, never a silent write; the on-disk source is **byte-unchanged** (asserted).
  8 tests + a runnable pilot. `canvas_std` git-diff 0 throughout.
- **P2 — the firewall touch + the Standard-version cut.** `canvas_std.reserved.validate_interaction` (I-1/I-2/I-3) on
  the aDNA-Native `validate()` path + `validate_suite` + the `canvas-std` CLI + one interaction golden; the consumer's
  `validate_interaction_block` → a **thin delegate** (one source of truth). `interaction_version 1.0` **cut into Standard
  v2.2.0** at every version site (schema `$id` kept; v2.1.0 reserved for LIP-0008); the `spec_conformance_suite §4.1` +
  `spec_interface_surface §9.1/§10` forward-pointers flipped to "implemented." Firewall touch **+159/−9 across 9 files**;
  the P2 exit gate was **full-regression-green** (not git-diff 0), per `adr_007` §3.
- **P3 — close.** Structural `iii/` review (`iii/feedback_2026_06_23_leg3_interaction_runtime.md` — 0 High / 0 Med →
  SHIP, 3 Low); patterns graduated → `what/context/context_canvas_surface_legs.md` (Principles 6–9); the leg-3 backlog
  idea marked `implemented`; the OIP `v1.x` re-anchor filed as a deferred stub; doc currency; firewall restored to
  git-diff 0; campaign closed; **P0–P3 pushed to GitHub-public `aDNA-Network/Canvas.aDNA`** (operator-authorized).

### Descoped
- **An unconditional authoritative write to `.lattice.yaml`** — the governed write is **advisory** (a reviewed draft);
  `spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2 §1.2` forbids silent source propagation (D4).
- **Capture runtime / gate engine** — stayed a thin pilot path; the gate engine remains ISS's (D7, ADR-006 §2).
- **The OIP `v1.x` re-anchor build** — filed as a deferred stub only (D8; cross-vault dep on the unopened `aDNA.aDNA`
  OIP-unification campaign).
- **A `canvas_std` `[2.0.2]` CHANGELOG back-fill** — a pre-existing doc gap; firewall-gated out of P3 (a future
  editorial PATCH; recorded in the `iii/` review L3 + the AAR).

### Key Findings
- **A governed write is governed *because* it is advisory.** The runtime's whole value is making the reverse path
  *reviewable* — a draft + delta + staleness + conflicts + the response payload, with the on-disk source provably
  byte-unchanged. The reuse line fell where the spec drew it: `merge`/`diff` already do the topology; the §6 lossy-field
  restore + the never-touch-source discipline were the only net-new code.
- **The firewall lifts cleanly as a bounded ADR.** Naming the single phase + two purposes + the replacement gate
  (full-regression-green for git-diff 0) kept a "first-ever edit" to **+159/−9** — small, isolated, reviewable. Landing
  the logic behind the old version's tests first (105 green at 2.0.2) proved non-breaking before the version cut.
- **R1 was the load-bearing correctness call.** `validate_reserved` already runs `validate_anchors` on the aDNA-Native
  branch, so the new `validate_interaction` must do I-1/I-2/I-3 *only* — a re-call would double-emit A-5. A dedicated
  test locks it.
- (Graduated to `context_canvas_surface_legs.md` Principles 6–9 + 2 anti-patterns.)

### Scope Changes
- The governed write is **advisory-reverse** (a reviewed draft), not the unconditional authoritative write the idea-stub
  seed first named — the honest reading of `spec_roundtrip_protocol_v2 §1.2` (D4).
- `canvas_context.STANDARD_VERSION` + package version bumped (`2.0.2`/`0.3.0` → `2.2.0`/`0.3.1`) beyond the plan's
  "optional, leave" — for vault-wide coherence + to mark the delegate refactor.

### Follow-Up
- **`idea_oip_v1x_interface_reanchor`** (filed, deferred) — graduates to a mission when the `aDNA.aDNA` OIP-unification
  campaign lands its interface/interaction thesis.
- **A `canvas_std` `[2.0.2]` CHANGELOG back-fill** — future editorial PATCH (firewall-gated out of P3).
- LIP-0008 (→ v2.1.0) closes 2026-06-27; v2.1.0 stays reserved for it.

## Campaign AAR

- **Worked**: the Keystone-model build with the firewall touch isolated to a single, separately-gated phase. P1 (the
  larger build) stayed firewall-clean, so the *risky* edit (P2) was small and landed behind the old version's tests
  first — green before the cut, a clean mechanical version pass after. Every gate HELD; nothing auto-advanced.
- **Didn't**: nothing failed. The one real judgment was the consumer delegate — the *pure* delegate (dropping
  `validate_anchors` from `validate_interaction_block`) held all 58 green because no test relied on that A-5 emission and
  the well-formed fixture resolves its label anchor via the doc path (graph path == doc path).
- **Finding**: "governed = advisory done safely" + "lift the firewall as a bounded ADR, swap git-diff-0 for
  full-regression-green" are the two durable patterns — graduated to `context_canvas_surface_legs.md`.
- **Change**: bumped the consumer's version constants (beyond the plan's optional) for coherence; surfaced the
  pre-existing `[2.0.2]` CHANGELOG gap as a finding rather than fixing it in a git-diff-0 phase.
- **Follow-up**: the OIP `v1.x` re-anchor stub (gated on the `aDNA.aDNA` OIP campaign) + the `[2.0.2]` CHANGELOG
  back-fill (future editorial PATCH). The three-leg thesis is complete; no further Armature work.
